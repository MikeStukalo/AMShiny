	<p>This Shiny App was developed as a part of the NYC Data Science
	Academy Bootcamp.</p>
	<p>The application illustrates the key principles of portfolio
	optimization.</p>
	<p>In <strong>Theory</strong> section we talk about diversification
	and portfolio composition. Also, we introduce key performance
	measures that are later used in our backtesting.</p>
	<p><strong>Backtesting</strong> section allows user to choose a
	portfolio comprised of six arguably most popular asset classes as
	well as to choose a desired rebalancing schedule. The resulting
	portfolio is compared to Russell2000 performance and the performance
	of the portfolio consisting of 60% Russell, 10% Treasury Bonds, and
	30% Corporate Bonds as a proxy of typical “60/40” portfolio.</p>
	<p>The user can select a date range for which the backtesting is
	performed (don't forget to press <strong>Backtest</strong> button).
	On <strong>Allocation Comparison</strong> tab the user portfolio is
	compared to two optimal buy-and-hold portfolios for the same date
	range: a portfolio with the same return and lower risk, and a
	portfolio with the same risk and higher return.</p>
	<p>You can learn more about me on <strong>The Author</strong> page.</p>
